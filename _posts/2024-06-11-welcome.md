You made it! This is your first post. Edit it or add a new file in the `_posts` directory to publish something new. The filename should follow the `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` pattern.

Jekyll will turn Markdown into HTML when the site builds, so keep writing in plain text and let the generator handle the rest.
