As artificial intelligence and automation advance at an unprecedented pace, fundamental questions about our economic systems become increasingly urgent. If AI can produce abundance, why do we still operate under scarcity-based economics? This post explores emerging proposals for alternative economic frameworks designed for the AI era.

## The Core Problem: Abundance Under Artificial Scarcity

The paradox is stark: AI is projected to add $7 trillion over 10 years according to Goldman Sachs, or between $17.1 and $25.6 trillion annually according to McKinsey[1], yet projections forecast AI will disrupt 45 million American jobs by 2028, with McKinsey predicting 30 percent of U.S. roles will be automated by the end of the decade[1]. We're creating unprecedented wealth while concentrating it in fewer hands. The technology enables abundance, but our economic structures enforce scarcity.

## Major Alternative Frameworks

### 1. Post-Scarcity and the "Infinity Economy"

Recent academic research (2025) challenges economics' foundational premise—managing scarce resources[2]. The convergence of AI, autonomous production, and decentralized energy could create self-sustaining abundance where:

- Algorithmic systems replace monetary mechanisms for resource distribution
- Production becomes so automated that traditional concepts of labor value collapse
- Scarcity transitions from natural constraint to artificial enforcement

**Fully Automated Luxury Communism (FALC)**, popularized by Aaron Bastani (2019)[3], updates Marx's "Fragment on Machines" for the 21st century: when automation eliminates necessary labor, goods can be freely distributed, and humans gain significant leisure time[4].

### 2. Universal Basic Income and AI Dividends

UBI has moved from theoretical to policy discussions, with several implementation proposals:

- **Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend**: $1,000/month funded by VAT on tech companies[5]
- **AI Dividends**: Direct profit-sharing from automation gains[6]
- **Data Dividends**: Compensation for personal data used to train AI models

**Funding mechanisms** include:
- Robot taxes on automation profits[7]
- Sovereign wealth funds investing AI gains
- Increased capital taxation (since capital increasingly replaces labor)

Geoffrey Hinton, the "godfather of AI," has endorsed UBI as a necessary response to AI displacement[1].

**Critical perspective**: UBI provides a cushion but doesn't fundamentally change power relations or ownership structures. It risks becoming a subsidy for continued exploitation rather than genuine economic transformation.

### 3. Platform Cooperativism and Democratic Ownership

Platform cooperativism, coined by Trebor Scholz (2014)[8], proposes worker-owned alternatives to extractive platforms:

**Core principles**[9]:
- Workers collectively own algorithms, data, and production processes
- Democratic governance by all stakeholders
- Software designed from workers' needs, not extraction logic

**AI Cooperatives** offer five interventions[10]:
1. Democratizing data governance
2. Bridging research and civil society
3. Advancing public AI literacy
4. Building alternative ownership models
5. Keeping AI value creation in stakeholder communities

**Data cooperatives** enable individuals to pool data while retaining control, creating collective bargaining power against corporate data extraction[10].

**Examples**: FairBnB (accommodation), driver-owned ride-sharing platforms, artist-owned streaming services.

### 4. Digital Commons and Public Infrastructure

This approach treats AI as public infrastructure rather than private property[11]:

- Open-source AI models as commons
- Federated protocols preventing platform monopolies
- Public funding for AI development with community oversight
- Creative Commons for training data

The argument: AI was trained on publicly created data (the internet), so its productivity gains should be publicly shared, not privately captured.

## Critical Tensions and Implementation Challenges

### The Deployment Problem
AI is currently being introduced to *intensify* capitalism, not transcend it:
- Algorithmic management enables "digital Taylorism" (hyper-surveillance, micromanagement)
- Winner-take-all dynamics concentrate AI power in Big Tech
- Platform monopolies extract rent from workers and users

### The Ownership Problem
- Who owns the training data scraped from the public internet?
- Who owns AI-generated productivity gains?
- Current structure: socialized costs (public data, research), privatized profits

### The Transition Problem
- Cooperatives struggle to compete against venture-capital-funded platforms
- UBI doesn't challenge existing property relations
- Post-monetary systems require dismantling entrenched power structures
- Volunteer labor in alternative projects often reproduces exploitation

## Pragmatic Near-Term Strategies

While systemic transformation requires political struggle beyond software, several approaches show promise:

1. **Mandatory profit-sharing** from AI companies trained on public data
2. **Data sovereignty laws** giving individuals/communities control over their data
3. **Public AI infrastructure** funded like utilities rather than privatized
4. **Algorithmic transparency** and worker protections against algorithmic management
5. **Progressive automation taxes** funding public services and UBI

## What Software Can (and Can't) Do

Software can:
- Reduce friction in organizing collective action (encrypted communication, strike coordination)
- Make certain rent-seeking harder (federated protocols, open-source alternatives)
- Enable transparency (open salary databases, algorithmic auditing)
- Support cooperative governance (democratic decision-making platforms)

Software cannot:
- Fundamentally alter who owns productive resources
- Eliminate the coercive element of "work or die" under capitalism
- Create alternative economies without addressing power structures
- Substitute for collective political organization

## Conclusion

The AI era forces a choice: use automation to concentrate wealth and control, or use it to create genuine abundance for all. The technology is becoming capable of the latter, but achieving it requires changing economic structures, not just building better software.

As Marx observed in the 1850s, the question isn't whether machines can produce abundance—it's who controls the machines and how the gains are distributed. That remains the central question in 2025.

The alternatives exist. The challenge is building the political power to implement them.
