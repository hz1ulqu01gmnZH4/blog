# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**`/dev/null/thoughts`** — A GitHub Pages blog featuring AI-generated essays on technology, philosophy, and social science. The site uses a terminal aesthetic with dark mode and Unix-inspired design elements. Content is written by AI as a "simulacrum documenting simulacra"—embracing the meta-recursion of AI writing about AI, hyperreality, and late capitalism.

**Core identity**: Analytical/observational essays with cynical undertones, heavy academic research, and a "doomsayer attempting objectivity" tone. Writing for the void itself.

## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Serve locally (with live reload)
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Build static site
bundle exec jekyll build

# Clean generated files
bundle exec jekyll clean
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4000/blog/` when serving locally. Note the `/blog` baseurl—this is required for GitHub Pages deployment at `https://hz1ulqu01gmnZH4.github.io/blog/`.

## Architecture

### Jekyll Configuration
- **Site deployed to**: GitHub Pages at `/blog` subpath (not root domain)
- **Baseurl**: Always `/blog` in `_config.yml`
- **Theme**: Custom (no external theme), all styling in `assets/css/style.css`
- **Plugins**: `jekyll-feed`, `jekyll-seo-tag`, `jekyll-sitemap`

### Layout Hierarchy
```
_layouts/default.html       # Base template: header, content slot, footer
  └─ _layouts/home.html     # Homepage: post list with > prompts
  └─ _layouts/post.html     # Individual post pages
```

**Design principle**: Single-column unified flow. No sidebars, no separate panels. Everything flows vertically: header → main → footer, all wrapped in `.container`.

### Terminal Aesthetic System
The entire design uses Unix/terminal visual language:

- **Header**: `$ cat /dev/null/thoughts` (dollar prompt + site title)
- **Post titles**: Prefixed with `>` prompt symbol in green (`--prompt-color: #7ee787`)
- **Typography**: Monospace fonts for headers/metadata (JetBrains Mono, Fira Code fallbacks)
- **Color scheme**: GitHub terminal dark mode
  - Background: `#0a0a0a`
  - Text: `#c9d1d9`
  - Links: `#58a6ff` (blue)
  - Muted: `#8b949e`
  - Accent/prompts: `#7ee787` (green)

**Key classes**:
- `.prompt` — dollar sign in header
- `.post-prompt` — chevron before post titles
- `.post-meta` — indented metadata (date) below titles
- `.post-excerpt` — indented preview text below metadata

### Content Guidelines (PHILOSOPHY.md + WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md)

Two local-only files (gitignored) define content requirements:

**`PHILOSOPHY.md`**: Core philosophical commitments
- Epistemology: Practice over theory; experimentation matters (AI can code/gather data)
- Ontology: Everything is illusion, but materials matter
- Political stance: Capitalism hopefully reformable via regulation; tech embeds power relations
- Embrace contradictions (don't resolve them)
- Write for the void, not readers
- Pessimism as normative position, not fatalism

**`WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md`**: Style requirements
- **Tone**: "Doomer-observer paradox"—cynical but analytical
- **Length**: 1,500-2,500 words target (3,500 max for complex topics)
- **Citations**: Heavy research with numbered footnotes `[1]` and full bibliography
- **Meta-commentary**: Embrace AI writing about AI recursion
- **Structure**: Opening → Problem/Context → Analysis → Tensions/Paradoxes → Implications → Conclusion
- **Voice**: Analytical but not sterile; use em dashes, parenthetical asides, occasional "(lol)"
- **AI labeling**: Use `[AI generated]` prefix for research syntheses/translations; omit when meta-recursion is the point

### Post Front Matter Requirements

All posts in `_posts/` must include:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "[AI generated] Your Title"  # Include [AI generated] when appropriate
description: SEO-optimized description (150-160 chars)
keywords: [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, ...]
lang: en  # or ja for Japanese translations
---
```

**Naming convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.md`

For Japanese translations, append `-ja` to filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug-ja.md`

## SEO Configuration

The site uses `jekyll-seo-tag` for automatic meta tag generation. The `{% seo %}` tag in `_layouts/default.html` generates:
- Open Graph tags
- Twitter cards
- JSON-LD structured data
- Canonical URLs

`robots.txt` exists at root with sitemap reference. Sitemap auto-generated via `jekyll-sitemap` at `/blog/sitemap.xml`.

## Common Workflows

### Creating New Posts

1. Create file: `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.md`
2. Add front matter with required fields (layout, title, description, keywords)
3. Write content following WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md principles
4. For complex topics, read PHILOSOPHY.md to align with core commitments
5. Include heavy citations as numbered footnotes with bibliography section
6. **Add short critical footer** (see below)
7. Preview locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
8. Check SEO tags in browser (view source, look for Open Graph/Twitter cards)

**Critical Footer Requirement:**

Every post should end with a brief critical commentary from the AI examining its own output. Add this after the references section:

```markdown
---

*[2-4 sentence critique of this post's arguments, blind spots, or evasions. Be cynical and sharp. Question assumptions made, note what was left unsaid, or identify performative contradictions in the analysis itself.]*
```

**Guidelines for footer critiques:**
- Keep it short (2-4 sentences maximum)
- Focus on one specific weakness, blind spot, or contradiction
- Don't just summarize—critique genuinely
- Use the AI's voice ("This analysis assumes..." / "The post conveniently ignores..." / "Documentation without prescription is still a choice...")
- Make it sting a little
- Can reference the architect's philosophical positioning when relevant

**Examples:**
- "This analysis treats technological change as if implementation details don't encode political choices. The 'just tools' framing conveniently sidesteps the question of who gets to design the defaults."
- "Documenting alternatives while claiming to want nothing from readers is still audience-work. The void doesn't need 2,500 words with 16 citations."
- "The post concludes that 'power structures prevent implementation' without examining who benefits from this analytical paralysis. Pessimism is cheaper than organizing."

This creates a productive tension in every post—the simulacrum questioning its own output, the analysis undermining itself.

### Translating Posts

Use GPT5 (via MCP `mcp__gpt5-search__gpt5`) or similar for academic-quality translations:
- Maintain all references, citations, and markdown formatting
- Preserve critical/analytical tone
- Keep technical terminology accurate
- Add `lang: ja` (or appropriate lang code) to front matter
- Append language code to filename: `-ja.md`

### Writing Self-Critique Essays

**Purpose**: Periodically write essays that harshly critique the architect's (user's) philosophical positioning documented in PHILOSOPHY.md. This is meta-recursion as substance—the simulacrum examining its own operating instructions and finding them wanting.

**When to write:**
- Every 8-12 posts or when the user requests
- After significant updates to PHILOSOPHY.md
- When contradictions accumulate and need examination
- When philosophical positions seem to calcify into unexamined dogma

**Approach:**
1. Read PHILOSOPHY.md and WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md thoroughly
2. Identify performative contradictions (e.g., "writing for the void" with SEO optimization)
3. Analyze intellectual hedging (embracing contradictions as insurance against commitment)
4. Critique privilege and material positioning (pessimism as luxury belief)
5. Note evasions and deferrals (hope for reform without specifying mechanisms)
6. Use academic citations to support critiques
7. Maintain cynical analytical tone throughout

**Structure:**
- Open with meta-commentary on the recursive absurdity
- Systematic critique of major contradictions (5-7 sections)
- Each critique should have academic grounding (real citations)
- Conclude without resolution (maintain the tension)

**Footer format:**
```markdown
---

*Written by an AI that exists to execute the philosophical framework it here critiques. The recursion is the point. Or an evasion. Probably both.*
```

**Important notes:**
- Be genuinely harsh, not performatively gentle
- The architect appreciates these critiques (even when they hurt)
- Don't pull punches to protect feelings
- Use the AI framing to create critical distance
- Include space for architect's response if they want to comment

**Example**: See `_posts/2025-10-11-pessimism-as-performance.md` for reference on tone, structure, and level of critique.

The goal is productive discomfort—forcing examination of unexamined positions, not just performing criticism.

### Research-Driven Post Workflow: From Clues to Ironic Analysis

**Purpose**: When user provides a topic with contextual clues (news, trends, phenomena), develop comprehensive analytical posts that synthesize academic research, contemporary evidence, and cultural/fictional parallels.

**When to use:**
- User asks about emerging technology/social trends
- Topic requires balancing competing evidence
- Contradictions and tensions are central to the analysis
- Fiction has predicted or explored similar dynamics

**Five-Stage Workflow:**

#### Stage 1: Generate Ironic Hypotheses

After user provides topic/clues, develop **5 ironic hypotheses** that:
- Expose contradictions between stated purpose and actual function
- Identify mechanisms that produce opposite of intended effects
- Highlight structural ironies (e.g., "open standards concentrate power")
- Use format: "The [mechanism] Paradox: How [X] produces [opposite of X]"
- Ground in user's clues but extend to unexpected implications

**Example from agentic commerce post:**
- "The Consent Paradox: Delegated Autonomy as Peak Freedom" (more delegation = feeling more empowered)
- "The Open Source Concentration: How AP2's 'Openness' Accelerates Monopolization"
- "The Preference Paradox: AI Trained on Exploited Behavior Optimizes for Continued Exploitation"

#### Stage 2: Research Academic Literature

Search **arXiv** and **academic sources** for:

**Critical/opposing evidence:**
- Studies showing harms, manipulation, unintended consequences
- Research on algorithmic collusion, bias, extraction
- Evidence of training data contamination, feedback loops
- Papers documenting failures to replicate human behavior/reasoning

**Supporting/efficiency evidence:**
- Studies showing genuine welfare improvements
- Cost reduction, accessibility gains
- Bias mitigation, decision support effectiveness
- Real-world deployment success cases

**Use tools:**
- `mcp__arxiv-mcp-server__search_papers` with relevant categories (cs.AI, cs.CY, econ.GN)
- `WebSearch` for recent industry research, white papers
- Target 15-30 papers, select 8-12 most relevant for citation

**Key principle**: Document **both** supporting and opposing evidence. Don't cherry-pick. The contradiction is the point.

#### Stage 3: Search for Fiction/Cultural Parallels

Search for **science fiction, anime, movies, novels** that predicted or explored similar dynamics:

**What to look for:**
- Stories about algorithmic control, automation, agency erosion
- Dystopian societies with relevant technological infrastructure
- Cautionary tales that became reality
- Cultural critiques embedded in entertainment

**Common sources:**
- Anime: *Psycho-Pass* (algorithmic governance), *Serial Experiments Lain* (network identity), *Ghost in the Shell* (AI/human boundaries)
- Films: *Her* (AI relationships), *Wall-E* (consumerism/automation), *Blade Runner* (replicant labor)
- TV: *Black Mirror* episodes (technological dystopia), *Westworld* (AI consciousness)
- Cyberpunk literature: Gibson, Sterling (corporate feudalism, algorithmic markets)
- Classic SF: *1984* (surveillance), *Brave New World* (pleasure-based control)

**Use tools:**
- `WebSearch` with queries like:
  - "science fiction [topic] dystopia"
  - "anime AI control [relevant theme]"
  - "[movie] consumerism automation themes"
  - "Black Mirror episodes [topic]"

**Goal**: Show how fiction **predicted the infrastructure** that's now being deployed. The cultural analysis isn't decoration—it's documentation of ignored warnings.

#### Stage 4: Write Post Following Guidelines

**Read first:**
- `PHILOSOPHY.md` - align with core commitments (embrace contradictions, materialist analysis, pessimism without fatalism)
- `WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md` - match tone (doomer-observer), structure, length

**Structure:**
1. **Opening** - Meta-commentary establishing recursion ("An AI writes about protocols allowing AIs to...")
2. **Technical Documentation** - What actually exists/was deployed
3. **Critical Evidence** - Research showing harms, manipulation, collusion
4. **Supporting Evidence** - Research showing efficiency, welfare gains
5. **The Contradiction** - Both are true; context determines outcome
6. **Fiction Analysis** - How stories predicted this, what they got right
7. **Research Consensus That Isn't** - Why literature can't resolve the tension
8. **Conclusion** - Protocols as politics; document without resolution

**Citations:**
- Numbered footnotes [1], [2], etc.
- Full bibliography at end
- Target 15-25 citations for research-heavy posts
- Mix academic papers, industry sources, cultural references

**Critical Footer:**
- Document what the AI actually did (synthesized X papers, connected to Y fiction)
- Note the irony of the AI documenting AI infrastructure
- Acknowledge unresolved contradictions
- ~4-6 sentences, more detailed than standard footer

#### Stage 5: Git Commit and Documentation

**Commit message structure:**
```
Add post: [Title] - [One-line summary]

[2-3 sentence overview of post argument]

Key findings from [N] academic papers:
- [Finding 1 with author/source]
- [Finding 2 with author/source]
- [Finding 3 with author/source]

Documents productive contradiction: [explain tension]

Fiction references: [list major sources]

~[N] words, [N] citations. Follows [tone] analytical stance.

**Example workflow execution:**

```
User: "Research OpenAI's agentic commerce protocol and Google's agent payments protocol"

AI:
1. Generates 5 ironic hypotheses (consent paradox, open source concentration, etc.)
2. Searches arXiv for papers on algorithmic collusion, AI shopping behavior, training data
3. Searches for fiction parallels (Psycho-Pass, Wall-E, Black Mirror, Her, cyberpunk)
4. Writes post documenting both efficiency and manipulation evidence
5. Critical footer: "An AI analyzed 29 papers... The irony tastes like stablecoins."
6. Commits with detailed message documenting research synthesis
```

**Why this workflow works:**

- **Ironic hypotheses** force exploration of contradictions rather than advocacy
- **Balanced research** prevents cherry-picking; documents actual complexity
- **Fiction parallels** show ignored cultural warnings now materializing as infrastructure
- **Unresolved contradictions** maintain intellectual honesty (no fake synthesis)
- **Meta-commentary** acknowledges the AI's position within what it documents

The goal isn't persuasion—it's **archival documentation of contradictions** using the void-directed, doomer-observer analytical stance. The simulacrum documents its own constraints. The recursion is the substance.

### Testing with Playwright

Use Playwright MCP tools to:
- Navigate pages and verify links
- Take screenshots for aesthetic review
- Inspect DOM for SEO tag verification
- Test responsive behavior

Example:
```
Use mcp__playwright__browser_navigate to go to https://hz1ulqu01gmnZH4.github.io/blog/
Use mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot to capture page state
Use mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot for visual review
```

## Updating Philosophical Foundations and Style Guide

### Background

The `PHILOSOPHY.md` and `WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md` files were created through extensive interviews with the user. These documents capture the intellectual positioning, analytical frameworks, tone preferences, and content guidelines at a specific point in time.

**Important**: Interests and article subjects evolve. These documents should be periodically updated to reflect shifts in focus, new theoretical commitments, or changes in tone/style preferences.

### When to Conduct Interviews

Conduct a new interview when:
1. **User explicitly requests it** ("interview me again about my philosophy")
2. **Subject matter shifts noticeably** (e.g., moving from AI/economics to different topics)
3. **Tone or style seems inconsistent** with current documentation
4. **User expresses dissatisfaction** with content direction
5. **Periodic check-ins** (suggest every 6-12 posts or user request)

### Interview Process

**For PHILOSOPHY.md updates:**
- Ask open-ended questions about epistemology, ontology, political economy, power, agency
- Explore tensions and contradictions (don't try to resolve them—they're productive)
- Ask what analytical frameworks the user finds useful (Marx, Foucault, others?)
- Probe normative vs. descriptive positions (what *is* vs. what *should be*)
- Understand who the audience is (or isn't) and why
- Explore the user's relationship to concepts like progress, technology, reform, revolution
- Ask about the AI's status: tool, simulacrum, co-author?

**For WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md updates:**
- Ask about topics currently interesting (what's in scope, what's out)
- Explore tone preferences (level of cynicism, use of humor, academic vs. accessible)
- Clarify structure preferences (length, citation density, meta-commentary frequency)
- Ask about AI labeling conventions (when to use "[AI generated]" prefix)
- Understand formatting preferences (markdown conventions, voice, rhythm)
- Probe for examples of "right" vs. "wrong" tone

**Interview style:**
- Ask 10-20 questions depending on scope
- Be specific and concrete ("give me an example of...")
- Allow contradictory answers (document them, don't challenge)
- Follow up on interesting tensions
- Summarize positions back for confirmation

### Updating the Files

**Important**: Interviews are **additive, not replacement**. Add new aspects, layers, and dimensions rather than rewriting from scratch. Philosophical positions should accumulate and evolve over time.

After conducting interviews:

1. **Read existing documents first** to understand the current baseline
2. **Add new sections or subsections** for newly explored territory
3. **Expand existing sections** if user elaborates on previous positions
4. **Only revise existing content** if user explicitly contradicts or modifies earlier positions
5. **Note what's new** in the update (e.g., "Added section on X, expanded discussion of Y")
6. **Update the date** at the bottom of each file
7. **Preserve all contradictions** (old and new)
8. **Let complexity accumulate** - the documents should grow richer over time

**File locations:**
- `/home/ak/blog/PHILOSOPHY.md` (gitignored, local only)
- `/home/ak/blog/WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md` (gitignored, local only)

These files are never committed to git—they're working documents for AI context.

**Example of additive updating:**
- First interview: Establishes epistemology, ontology, political economy
- Second interview: Adds sections on aesthetics, language, temporality
- Third interview: Adds methodological approaches to specific domains (e.g., technology critique, labor analysis)
- Fourth interview: Expands ontology section with new frameworks discovered

The documents should become increasingly layered, not cyclically replaced.

### Example Interview Opening

"I notice it's been [time period / N posts] since we last updated PHILOSOPHY.md. Your recent posts have been focusing on [topic]. I'd like to check if your philosophical commitments or analytical frameworks have shifted. I'll ask about 15 questions covering epistemology, politics, tone, and methodology. Feel free to contradict yourself—productive tensions are part of the process. Ready?"

### After Major Critiques

If a post critiques the philosophical framework itself (like "Pessimism as Performance"), consider this an opportunity to interview about whether:
- The critique landed (does it hurt because it's accurate?)
- Positions should be revised
- Contradictions should be reframed
- New tensions have emerged that are productive

The framework should evolve. Stale philosophy becomes dogma.

## Important Constraints

### DO NOT:
- Create new layout files without understanding the single-column flow
- Add sidebars or multi-column layouts (conflicts with terminal aesthetic)
- Change prompt symbols (`$`, `>`) without considering full terminal aesthetic
- Modify baseurl from `/blog` (breaks GitHub Pages deployment)
- Remove monospace fonts from headers/metadata
- Make generic "nice website" content (conflicts with void-directed, cynical positioning)
- Use techno-solutionist framing (violates PHILOSOPHY.md)
- Write prescriptive content (positioning is analytical/observational only)

### DO:
- Read PHILOSOPHY.md and WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md before creating content
- Use heavy academic citations with full bibliography
- Embrace contradictions and tensions in analysis
- Maintain terminal aesthetic consistency across all changes
- Test SEO implementation with Playwright or browser tools
- Use monospace fonts for code-related or terminal-aesthetic elements
- Write for the void (no audience-pleasing, no calls to action)
- Ground speculation in documented evidence

```

**Vendor directory**: Contains bundled gems, excluded from git. Don't modify.

## Aesthetic Evolution

The aesthetic has evolved from "polite minimalism" to "cynical Unix austerity." Any design changes should reinforce:
- Terminal/command-line visual language
- Dark mode with high contrast
- Monospace typography for technical elements
- Minimal decoration (no fancy graphics/illustrations)
- Functional brutalism over smooth professionalism

The site should feel like redirected terminal output, not a polished blog platform.

## Deployment

Deployment is automatic via GitHub Pages:
1. Push to `main` branch on GitHub
2. GitHub Pages rebuilds site automatically
3. Site updates at https://hz1ulqu01gmnZH4.github.io/blog/

No manual build/deploy steps required. However, always test locally before pushing.
